# Organization and Project Roles

Everything you do on RedBrick AI will be within your Organization. All your team members, projects, annotations, etc., live inside your organization. You can view all the members in your organization inside the **Team Tab** on the left sidebar.&#x20;

To invite a member to your team, you need to enter their email address and select their role. Once you invite them, they will receive an **email invitation** at the email address you have entered.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you do not receive an email invitation, please check your Spam. If the invitation is not in Spam, you can accept the invitation directly from the application:

Sign up using the invited email address at [https://app.redbrickai.com/createaccount](https://app.redbrickai.com/createaccount), and accept the invitation once you log in.
{% endhint %}

## Roles

RedBrick AI offers role-based access control at two levels - the Organization level and the Project level. Each of these roles governs what actions a user can perform at the respective level.

### Organization Roles

### Project Permissions

You can invite specific users to individual projects and manage their permissions within the project.   Project permissions and teams can be managed under the **Workforce Tab** on your project dashboard.  &#x20;

| Role           | What they can do                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Project Admin  | Can perform administrative actions at the project level, like uploading data, assigning tasks, editing project settings, and seeing overview statistics & other user statistics. |
| Project Member | They can only annotate/review data that is assigned to them. Don't have permission to view the activity of other users.                                                          |

### Inviting Members

{% hint style="info" %}
**Organization admins** are invited to all projects by default. They will have **project admin** permissions in all projects.&#x20;

**Organization members** can be selectively invited to individual projects. They can be assigned either **project admin** or **project member** roles.
{% endhint %}

Assigning a project member to a particular stage restricts their access to tasks only from that stage. Both manual task assignment and automatic task assignment will be restricted.&#x20;
