# Comments and Raised Issues

RedBrick AI offers two primary ways of communicating with your team on the platform: **Comments** and **Raised Issues**.

## Comments

Comments are useful when:

* you feel the need to make a note of something and that note should be visible to other team members;
* you would like to point out a specific point on the canvas to others;
* you have to provide text-based feedback on something while annotating;

To leave a Comment, simply click on the **Comments** button in the top right of the Annotation Tool to reveal the Comments Panel. Provide the information you'd like to share and then click on **Comment**.

Optionally, you can pin your Comment to a point on the canvas by clicking on the **Pin the comment on canvas** button and then clicking again on the desired location.

All Comments for a Task are visible in the Task Details as well.

### Exporting Comments

You can export a CSV of all Comments recorded in a Project by navigating to the **Export Meta-data** section of your Project Settings.

## Raised Issues

### Instructions for Annotators

We recommend raising an issue when:

* you feel that you need to elevate a problem to an Administrator;
* you cannot continue work on a specific Task due to some sort of blocking issue;

To raise an Issue, simply click on the **Comments** button in the top right of the Annotation Tool to reveal the Comments Panel. Provide the information you'd like to share and then click on **the righthand Raise Issue button**.

After clicking the Raise Issue button, a dialog box will appear to confirm your choice to raise an Issue and remove the current Task from your Labeling Queue.&#x20;

Once an Administrator responds to your query, the Task will reappear in your Labeling Queue and you can continue work.

### Instructions for Administrators

As an Admin, you can easily filter out a list of Raised Issues in the Project Dashboard.&#x20;

After filtering out your Tasks, you can easiliy open the Task Details to respond to your annotator and send the Task back to them.
