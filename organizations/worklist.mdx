description: "The Worklist is an Organization-level record of a user's assigned and cached Tasks, intended to bring clarity to several aspects of each user's individual workflow on RedBrick AI:"

* **Outstanding Tasks:** your Worklist contains all of the Tasks assigned or cached to a user across all Projects, assembled in one place for ease of reference

* **Caching state:** your Worklist displays how many Tasks have been cached to your browser, as well as their size

* **Task progress:** your Worklist tracks the states (i.e. Skipped, Draft, Issue, Not Started, In Progress) and Stages (i.e. Label, Review, Ground Truth) of incomplete Tasks

Users can execute the following actions with their Worklist:

* **Open a Task in the Editor** - by clicking on the three-dot menu

* **Navigate to Project** - by clicking on the Project name

* **Uncache a Task** - by clicking on the **Uncache** icon next to a Task's three-dot menu

* **Uncache a Task and remove it from Worklist** - click the Task's checkbox and select **Uncache and remove** in the snackbar that appears at the bottom of the screen.

  * **Note:** this operation does not un-assign the Task from the currently assigned user

* **Filter Worklist Tasks** - by Project, Stage, Task ID and Task Progress
