# Project & Task Analytics

As of `version 1.1.0`, the RedBrick UI offers a variety of metrics in order to make tracking your (or your team's) progress easier than ever before.&#x20;

## Project Analytics

On your Project's Data Page, admins can easily access a variety of productivity-related information about the Project Workforce by using the lefthand toolbar and applying the desired filters.

Simply select the user whose metrics you'd like to see and apply a date range.
