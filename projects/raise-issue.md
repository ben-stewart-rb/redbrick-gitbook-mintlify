# Raise Issue

{% hint style="info" %}
* Labelers can raise an issue from the comments panel of the labeling tool
* Admins can respond to issues through the task history dialog.
* After a Labeler raises an issue, they will not be able to work on that task until the admin takes action it.
{% endhint %}

Often while annotating you may not be sure how to proceed. In these cases you can ask a question from a member of your team and the task will be removed from your queue until an Admin responds.

As an admin, you will be able to filter out a list of tasks that are in the issue state from the project dashboard. From this list you are able to open the task details and then view the task or respond and send the task back to be labeled.&#x20;
