# Installation & API Keys

## Installation

The RedBrick AI SDK and CLI are available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/redbrick-sdk/) and can be installed using `pip`. The SDK and CLI are packaged together.&#x20;

```bash
$ pip install -U redbrick-sdk
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The SDK and CLI work on Mac, Windows, and Linux. They are compatible with **Python versions: 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 & 3.11**
{% endhint %}

## API Keys

An API Key is needed to use either the Python SDK or Command Line Interface. Create an API key in the API Keys section on the left sidebar.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only Organization Admins can create API Keys. The API key will have all the same permissions that Organization Admins have.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Organization and Project IDs

For most SDK / CLI operations, you will need your organization and/or project ids. These are unique ids for each entity. You can find both the Organization and Project ID inside the **Settings Page of any Project**.&#x20;

You can also find the Organization and Project IDs within the browser URL -> head over to any project - https://app.redbrickai.com/\<org\_id>/projects/\<project\_id>.
