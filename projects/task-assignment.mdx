## What is a Task?

A Task is a unit of work that moves through your project pipeline in RedBrick AI. Tasks can consist of anything - a single image, series, or entire study, and your Labeler works with one Task at a time while annotating.

For example, if you'd like your Labelers to view & annotate an **entire MRI study** comprised of **4 series** together, you should upload the 4 series together as a single Task (see "Multi-series Task" below):

Please see our [data import documentation](/importing-data/import-cloud-data#items-list) for a more comprehensive overview of how to structure your data imports.

## Task Assignment in RedBrick AI

RedBrick AI allows you to delegate work among your team using either automatic or manual task assignment.

Any [Project Admin or Member](/organizations/what-is-an-organization#project-level-roles) with relevant permissions can view a Task on RedBrick AI.

### **Automatic Task Assignment**

Automatic Task Assignment is enabled by default upon Project creation. The automatic assignment protocol is a first-come-first-serve system, i.e. it assigns the oldest  **Tasks to the first annotators that request new Tasks.

Labelers can request new Tasks by clicking on the "Label/Review" buttons on the Project Dashboard.

<Info>
  You can disable Automatic Task Assignment in **Project Settings -> General Settings.**

### **Manual Assignment**

Admins can also override the automatic assignment protocol and manually assign Tasks to users from the **Data Page**.

<Info>
  RedBrick AI will not automatically re-assign Tasks that have been manually assigned.
</Info>

### **Programmatically Assigning Tasks**

You can programmatically assign tasks by prescribing the assignment during data upload as part of your [Items List](/importing-data/import-cloud-data/creating-an-items-list#upload-an-items-list-to-your-project) or using the [`assign_tasks()` method](https://redbrick-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sdk.html#redbrick.labeling.Labeling.assign_tasks) of our SDK.

#### Assigning Tasks on Upload

You can use the [`preAssign`](/python-sdk/formats/full-format-reference#preassign-stagename-string-string) field in the to assign a Task you are uploading to a specific user(s) at each Stage.

For example, the snippet below will assign `study_001` to `annotator@email.com` in the Label Stage. Once the annotation is complete, the Task will be queued in `Review_1` and `reviewer@email.com` will be assigned as the Reviewer.

```
[
    {
        "name": "study_001", 
        "preAssign": {
            "Label": "annotator@email.com",
            "Review_1": "reviewer@email.com"
        },
        "series": [
            {
                "items": "ImageFile.extension", 
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

<Info>
  Always double check that your Stage Names (i.e., Label, Review\_1, etc.) and user emails have been input correctly.

  Also, when preassigning Tasks, all emails must be associated with an existing Project Member.
</Info>

#### Assigning Tasks after Upload

You can use the assign\_tasks() method to designate task assignment using the SDK. Please see our [SDK Documentation](https://redbrick-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sdk.html#redbrick.labeling.Labeling.assign_tasks) for further details.

## Labeling Queue

Once a Task is assigned to a user, it is added to their Labeling Queue. You can view your labeling queue in two ways.

1. **From the Data Page:** [On the Data Page](https://app.tango.us/app/workflow/Labeling-Queue-on-Data-Dashboard-b79b4d8562d34bc6a33d6cce0aa4476e), you can filter existing Tasks by **Queued for Labeling/Review** and then by Tasks assigned to you.

2. **In the Annotation Tool:** [The Labeling Queue](https://app.tango.us/app/workflow/View-Labeling-Queue-in-Tool-17a013c7a161415c85cba3369344cae2) can be expanded/retracted by clicking on the corresponding button in the top bar of the Annotation Tool.

While in your Queue, a Task can be in a few different states depending on the status of the annotation:

1. **Assigned** Tasks that you have not worked on yet will be displayed as Assigned.

2. **Saved** Once you save your in-progress annotation (either manually or through auto-save), the Task will show as saved.

3. **Pending Finalization** Once you are done with the annotation, you can **Submit a Draft**. All drafts that have been submitted will **still be in your Labeling Queue**  **pending finalization. You must finalize the draft to complete it and send it to the next stage of the workflow.

4. **Skipped** If you encounter a Task that you would like to complete at a later time, you can skip it to send it to the end of your Labeling Queue.

The diagram below is a visual guide to the flows associated with completing Tasks in your Labeling Queue, including associated actions and Task states.

## Task Prioritization

RedBrick AI allows you to designate specific Tasks as **prioritized**, which elevates them to the top of your Labeling Queue.

<Frame caption="Two Tasks with priority scores">
  <img src="/images/projects/files%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-MKt1BePyOQuVTnMGssE%252Fuploads%252FNRPjnQjwbXCFUd8EJXjS%252Fimage.png" />
</Frame>

Task Priority is reflected in the Web Application in the following ways:

1. Task Priority is visible in the Data Page when sorting by **Queued for Labeling/Review** or **Recently Labeled/Reviewed** - this logic applies to all Stages except for Ground Truth.

2. Task Priority will persist throughout Raising an Issue and/or Rejecting a Task at any Stage.

3. Task Priority will be visible in the Annotation Tool when viewing the Queue

4. Tasks that are Assigned and Prioritized will occupy a higher position in the queue than Tasks that are Unassigned and Prioritized.

As seen in the snippet below, you can use the [`update_tasks_priority()`](https://redbrick-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sdk.html#labeling) method to designate a float between 0 and 1 that reflects the priority of a given Task (where 1 is the highest priority and 0 is the lowest).

```
tasks = 
    [
        {
            # High Priority Task
            "taskId": "2716057",
            "priority": 0.95
        },
        {
            # Mid Priority Task
            "taskId": "BU221729",
            "priority": 0.50
        },
        {
            # Low Priority Task
            "taskId": "8675309",
            "priority": 0.32
        }
]
    
project.labeling.update_tasks_priority(
    stage_name="Label", 
    tasks=tasks
)
```

<Info>
  For the truly brave, our Prioritization API supports up to the billionth place for floats.

## Send to Stage

The **Send to Stage** action allows the user to move a Task from one Project Stage to another, overriding the standard project workflow.

Sending a Task to a different Stage may be useful if:

* As a labeler, you want to make edits to a Task you have already finalized;

* As an admin, you need to return a Task to a previous Stage without sending it all the way to the beginning of your pipeline;

* As an admin, you need a Task to skip over the review pipeline you've established;

To send a Task to a different Stage, simply access the Task's three-dot menu on the Data page and click on the desired destination Stage.

<Warning>
  The Send to Stage action is disabled for Consensus Projects!
</Warning>

## Task History

You can access a comprehensive list of Task events by clicking on the Task's Stage, bringing the functionality of the Python SDK's [`get_task_events()` function](https://sdk.redbrickai.com/sdk.html#redbrick.export.Export.get_task_events) to the Dashboard.
