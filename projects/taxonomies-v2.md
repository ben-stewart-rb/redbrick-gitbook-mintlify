# Taxonomies (V2)

Taxonomies provides a structured way of defining your object label categories. Taxonomies allow you to re-use a set of label classes and attributes over different projects.&#x20;



Taxonomy V2 works much in the same way as V1, with a few key differences:

1. Each category has a single object type - This makes it faster and easier to create a new label while annotating.
2. Classification is now re-organized into study and series classification
3. There is a new multi select attribute
4. There is no longer support for nested categories, to accomplish this you should use the select or multi select attributes on a particular object type.



Below is a fully walkthrough with all of the changes and a demonstration of how object types and classifications work.
