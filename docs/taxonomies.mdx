# Taxonomies

Taxonomies allow you to define the structures that you'd like to annotate in your project and apply them to your data quickly and accurately. They ensure all annotations follow a structured schema which is automatically imported to the left-hand sidebar of RedBrick AI's Annotation Tool.

### Object Label Types

Object Labels are the structures that your team will annotate on RedBrick AI.

When creating your Taxonomy, you must define a Label **Type** (e.g., "Segmentation") and a **Name** (e.g., "Edema") for each Object Label.

RedBrick AI supports the following Object Label Types.

### Object Label Attributes

Attributes allow you to add a deeper level of classification to your Object Labels. Attributes are commonly used to collect more information about a particular object (e.g., "True/False" for an Object titled "tumor malignancy"). RedBrick AI offers the following Attribute Types.

### Classifications

Classifications are data attributes that can be affixed to studies, individual Series, or individual video frames.

Just like Object Label Attributes, Classifications can be **Booleans**, **Single Selects**, **Multi-selects**, or **Text** fields, and there is no limit to the number of Classifications you can have in your Taxonomy.

**Study-Level Classifications** are a classification for an entire Task (e.g., an MRI study consisting of 4 Series).

**Series-Level Classifications** are applied to a single series (e.g., the T1 sequence from an MRI study).

**Instance-Level Classifications** are applied to a single frame of a video and are only available for 2D video formats.

## Creating Taxonomies

Taxonomies are created and stored at the Organization level, which allows you to use a single Taxonomy for several Projects.

To create a new Taxonomy in the UI, navigate to the **Taxonomies** page in the left-hand sidebar of the RedBrick web app and click on **Create Taxonomy**.

Taxonomies can also be created using the [`create_taxonomy()` SDK method](https://redbrick-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sdk.html#redbrick.organization.RBOrganization.create_taxonomy).

All Taxonomies must contain at least one Object Label or Classification in order to be successfully created.

## Modifying Taxonomies

Taxonomies can be modified on the **Taxonomies** page of the UI at any time.

Alternatively, you can use the [`update_taxonomy()` SDK method](https://redbrick-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sdk.html#redbrick.organization.RBOrganization.update_taxonomy) to modify a Taxonomy outside of the UI. Please note the following about modifying existing Taxonomies:

1. The `update_taxonomy()` method overwrites the current Taxonomy in its entirety;
2. If you delete an Object Category, Attribute, or Classification from your Taxonomy, all existing associated annotations will need to be updated;
3. Taxonomies that are being used in Projects cannot be deleted.

## Duplicating a Taxonomy

There are two ways to duplicate an existing Taxonomy in RedBrick's UI:

1. On the Taxonomies page, open the three-dot menu of the Taxonomy you'd like to duplicate and click on **Duplicate Taxonomy**.
2. Within the Taxonomy you'd like to duplicate, open the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of the screen and click on **Duplicate Taxonomy**.

You'll then be directed to provide a name for the newly duplicated Taxonomy. Input a unique name, click on **Create Taxonomy**, and you have successfully created a duplicate!

Walkthrough of Taxonomy 

**SDK Mastery:** When duplicating a Taxonomy, the archived elements of the Source Taxonomy are not transferred to the Duplicate Taxonomy.

Be sure to validate your [objectTypes](https://sdk.redbrickai.com/formats/taxonomy.html#redbrick.types.taxonomy.ObjectType) in the Duplicate Taxonomy, as values may have changed!

## Nesting Taxonomy Elements

Taxonomies now support the nesting of Object Labels, Study-Level, and Series-Level Classifications both in the UI and via the RedBrick AI Python SDK.

By adding the parents attribute to your Taxonomy, you can create and/or designate Parent Tiers for a given Object Label.

### Nesting Object Labels in the UI

In the Taxonomies page, simply click on **Add Folder** and give your folder a name.

You can then easily drag and drop your Object Labels or Classifications into your folder.

### Nesting Object Labels via SDK

You can create Parent Tiers by adding the `parents:[]` attribute to any Object Label, Study-Level, Series-Level, or Instance-Level Classification within your Taxonomy. Parent Tiers are created and assigned from **left to right and in descending order**, which means the first string in `parents:[]` will always be a Tier 1 Parent, the second string will be a Tier 2 Parent, and so on.

For full documentation, please see our [Taxonomy Object reference](../../python-sdk/formats/full-format-reference.md#taxonomy-object).

For an example of a two-tiered Object Label structure, please see the example code below:

```python
org.create_taxonomy_new(
    "Clinical Study 1",
        
    object_types=[
        {
            "category": "Herniated Disc",
            "labelType": "SEGMENTATION",
            "attributes": [],
            "color": "#7FFFD4",
            "classId": 0,
            # Creates the Tier 1 Parent 'Spine Pathologies' and Tier 2 Parent 'Disc Pathologies'
            "parents": ['Spine Pathologies', 'Disc Pathologies'],
        },
        {
            "category": "Bulging Disc",
            "labelType": "SEGMENTATION",
            "attributes": [],
            "color": "#DEB887",
            "classId": 1,
            "parents": ['Spine Pathologies', 'Disc Pathologies'],
        },
        {
            "category": "Degenerated Disc",
            "labelType": "SEGMENTATION",
            "attributes": [],
            "color": "#00FFFF",
            "classId": 2,
            "parents": ['Spine Pathologies', 'Disc Pathologies'],
        },
        {
            "category": "Vertebral Fracture",
            "labelType": "SEGMENTATION",
            "attributes": [],
            "color": "#FF7F50",
            "classId": 3,
            "parents": ['Spine Pathologies'],
        },
    ],
)
