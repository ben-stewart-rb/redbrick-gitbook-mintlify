There are two core use cases for multiple labeling on RedBrick AI:

1. [**Consensus, or multi-reader, single output:**](/project-settings-and-configuration/multiple-labeling/consensus)  ****Have multiple labelers annotate a single task and record their *inter-annotator agreement scores,* i.e., measure the overlap between their annotations. The output of consensus is a single set of ground truth.

2. [**Task duplication, or multi-reader, multiple output:**](/project-settings-and-configuration/multiple-labeling/task-duplication)  ****Have multiple annotators annotate a single image and generate N unique ground truth records for a single image.
