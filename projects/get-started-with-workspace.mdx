## Benefits of a Workspace

1. **Simplified data flows** - once your images are uploaded to a Workspace, you can create Projects and populate them with the data you choose in just a few clicks - no more uploading the same data to several slightly different Projects;

2. **Curate with cohorts** - Workspaces also function as a data curation layer, allowing you to create metadata, filter your images, and create cohorts for ease of organization;

3. **Visualize your data** - Workspaces offer a variety of charts and graphs as visual aids to complement your filtering and organization;

## Creating Workspace: Step by Step

To create a new workspace, Press the "New workspace" button on the top right corner or you can click on the "+" Icon on the left-hand menu bar and select New workspace from the dropdown.

### Step 1: Specify a Unique Workspace name

Once created, you won't be able to change the name of the workspace.

### Step 2: Uploading Data to workspace

Once the workspace is created, the next step is to upload the data. Uploading the data in the workspace is similar to how you [upload the data in the project](https://docs.redbrickai.com/importing-data/import-cloud-data). If you'd like to upload annotation files alongside your images and/or volumes, you must use our CLI/SDK.

### Step 3: Creating Project Inside Workspace

Next step is to create a project inside the newly created workspace, To create a new project click on the New Project button the top right corner.
