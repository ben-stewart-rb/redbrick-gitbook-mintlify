title: "Importing Annotations Guide"
description: "You can import all annotation types that are supported in RedBrick AI, including segmentations, classifications, bounding boxes, and more. Imported annotations will appear automatically on your annotator's interface."
---

<Warning>
  Annotations and images must be imported together at the start.

  If you want to add annotations programmatically to images that have already been uploaded, [please use the programmatic label & review](/python-sdk/sdk-overview/programmatic-label-and-review).
</Warning>

<Warning>
  Annotation import is only supported through the SDK and CLI.

  That is, you cannot use the [direct upload UI](/importing-data/uploading-data-to-redbrick) to import annotations, and you must use the items list with the SDK/CLI to provide the required metadata along with annotations.
</Warning>

To import images along with segmentations, you must provide us with:

1. Images in any supported format and NIftI segmentation files.

2. [An items list](/python-sdk/importing-annotations-guide#items-list-for-importing-segmentations) that provides a mapping of:

   * Segmentation files to volumes so that segmentations are applied to correct images.

   * Values within segmentation file to taxonomy categories.

<Check>
  Once you've prepared the [items list in the format defined below](/python-sdk/importing-annotations-guide#items-list-for-importing-segmentations), you can import the images and annotations using the [`create_datapoints` SDK method](/python-sdk/sdk-overview/importing-data-and-annotations) or [CLI `upload` method](/python-sdk/cli-overview/import-data-and-annotations).
</Check>

## Items list for importing segmentations

You can find the [full format reference here](/python-sdk/formats/full-format-reference#items-list-and-tasks.json). In this section, we will focus on importing segmentations. In the examples below, pay attention to the following fields:

1. `segmentations`: The segmentation files to be applied to the task.

2. `segmentMap`: Map the values present in the segmentation files to their corresponding taxonomy categories.

### I: One segmentation file per task

```
{
    "name": "...", 
    "series": [
        {
            "items": ["instance-01.dcm", "instance-02.dcm", ...],
            "segmentations": "segmentation.nii.gz",
            
            // Read more about "segmentMap"
            "segmentMap": {
                "1": "category-a", 
                "2": "category-b"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### II: Multiple segmentation files per task

Sometimes, segmentations for a single volume are stored in multiple segmentation files, but these segmentation files are not binary masks. In this case, follow the format below.

```
{
    "name": "...", 
    "series": [
        {
            "items": ["instance-01.dcm", "instance-02.dcm", ...],
            
            // Read more about "segmentations"
            "segmentations": ["segmentation-1.nii.gz", "segmentation-2.nii.gz"]
            
            // Read more about "segmentMap"
            "segmentMap": {
                "1": "category-a", 
                "2": "category-b"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Common mistakes for I and II.

<Warning>
  * The values 1 and 2 must be present in either `segmentation-1.nii.gz` or `segmentation-2.nii.gz.`

  * Values in `segmentation-1.nii.gz` & `segmentation-2.nii.gz` that are not in `segmentMap`will not map to any taxonomy category. This will result in uneditable, view-only annotations.

  * All values in `segmentation.nii.gz` that are not in `segmentMap` will not be mapped to any taxonomy category in the editor.
</Warning>

### III: Multiple binary segmentation files per task

A common pattern is to store each segmentation instance in a separate NIfTI file as a binary mask. In the example below, all non-zero values in `segmentation-1.nii.gz` are meant to correspond to the taxonomy category `category-a`.

```
{
    "name": "...", 
    "series": [
        {
            "items": ["instance-01.dcm", "instance-02.dcm", ...],
            
            // Read more about "segmentations"
            "segmentations": ["path/segmentation-1.nii.gz", "path/segmentation-2.nii.gz"]
            "segmentMap": {
            
                // Read more about "1"
                "1": {
                
                    // Read more about "category"
                    "category": "category-a", 
                    
                    // Read more about "mask"
                    "mask": "path/segmentation-1.nii.gz",                 
                }, 
                "2": {
                    "category": "category-b", 
                    "mask": "path/segmentation-2.nii.gz"
                }, 
                
                // Read more about "binaryMask"
                "binaryMask": true,
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
