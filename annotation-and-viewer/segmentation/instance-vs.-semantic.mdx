On the other hand, **instance segmentation** treats multiple objects of the same class as distinct individual objects (or instances). In the example below, the annotator must create a unique annotation (as represented by an Instance in Redbrick AI) for each specific vertebrae.

On RedBrick AI, you can **perform both semantic and instance segmentation** by controlling how many instances of a particular category you create on the left side bar. If you create more than one instance of a single category, on export, you will be able to correlate the instance ID's in your segmentation mask to your category names.
