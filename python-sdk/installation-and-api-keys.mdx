<Warning>
  Only Organization Admins can create API Keys. The API key will have all the same permissions that Organization Admins have.
</Warning>

## Organization and Project IDs

For most SDK / CLI operations, you will need your organization and/or project ids. These are unique ids for each entity. You can find both the Organization and Project ID inside the **Settings Page of any Project**.

You can also find the Organization and Project IDs within the browser URL -> head over to any project - https\://app.redbrickai.com/\<org\_id>/projects/\<project\_id>.
