# Inviting your team

Everything you do on RedBrick AI will be within your Organization. All your team members, projects, annotations etc. live inside your organization. You can view all the members in your organization inside the **Team Tab **_****_ found on the left side-bar.&#x20;

To invite a member to your team, you need to enter their email address and select their role. Once you invite them, they will receive an **email invitation** at the email address you have entered.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you do not receive an email invitation, please check Spam. If the invitation is not in Spam, you can accept the invitation directly from the application:

Sign up using the invited email address at [https://app.redbrickai.com/createaccount](https://app.redbrickai.com/createaccount), and accept the invitation once you log in.

## Organization Roles

There is a single owner of each organization, and there can be unlimited Admins and Labelers.&#x20;

| Role    | What they can access                                                                                                             |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Owner   | Has access to all assets within an organization, and ability create, edit, and delete assets including the organization itself.  |
| Admin   | Same permissions as an Owner, except does not have the ability to delete an organization.                                        |
| Labeler | Only able to access manual labeling and review stages. Only has access to projects, and not the data warehouse.                  |

## Project Permissions

You can invite specific users to individual projects and manage their permissions within the project.   Project permissions and teams can be managed under the **Workforce Tab** on your project dashboard. Please see the list below for information on project permissions. &#x20;

1. All Organization Admins by default are added to all projects.&#x20;
2. Admins & Owners can invite Organization Labelers to projects. By default _no labelers have access to any projects._ Labelers have to be invited to individual projects.&#x20;
3. Labelers can be assigned to specific project stages. By assigning a labeler to single or multiple stages, they will only be served tasks from those stages.&#x20;
