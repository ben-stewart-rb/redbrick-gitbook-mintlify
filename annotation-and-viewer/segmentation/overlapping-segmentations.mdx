title: "Overlapping Segmentations"
description: "If you are annotating multiple structures in the same pixel/voxel space, you can utilize overlapping segmentations in RedBrick AI."

Any time you are using a [Segmentation Tool](/annotation-and-viewer/segmentation/segmentation-tools) (e.g. Brush Tool, Pen Tool, Contour Tool, etc.), you can use the options in the [Masking Panel](/annotation-and-viewer/visualization-and-masking#masking) to configure your overlapping (or overwriting) behavior.

Specifically, you can utilize various combinations of the **Editable Area** and **Modify Other Segments** menus to determine how your annotations will be overlapped or overwritten. For a more comprehensive description of these menus and their functions, please reference [the relevant documentation](/annotation-and-viewer/visualization-and-masking#editable-area).

Alternatively, please see the following short tutorial for a visual walkthrough of the differences:

### Exporting Overlapping Segmentations

When exporting a Task with overlapping segmentations, RedBrick AI generates a unique annotation file for each segmentation.

The following JSON block is an example of how a single Task with two overlapping annotations will be exported.

```
projectId/
|-- TaskName
      |-- SeriesName.nii.gz // NIfTI file containing all annotations
      |-- SeriesName 
        |-- instance-1.nii.gz // NIfTI file for first overlapping segmentation
        |-- instance-2.nii.gz // NIfTI file for second overlapping segmentation
```
