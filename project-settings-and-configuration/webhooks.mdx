description: "Webhooks allow you to receive an HTTP push notification triggered by certain events within a project. Currently, webhooks are triggered by the following events:"
---

1. **Task created**: When a data point is uploaded, and a task is created from that data point.

2. **Task entered stage**: When a task enters a new stage in the labeling workflow.

3. **Task deleted**: When a task is deleted.

## Using webhooks

Configure webhook from project settings, as shown in the image below.

You can use tools like [https://webhook.site/](https://webhook.site/#!/view/8df76e5a-9a58-4394-8c65-854d305bb5be) to test the webhook and inspect the response format.
