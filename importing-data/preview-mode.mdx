To visualize your data (and, optionally, your annotations) in Preview Mode:

1. Click on **Preview Mode** in the left hand toolbar of the **Home Page**;

2. Within **Preview Mode**, select the image(s) you would like to display or simply drag and drop them into the corresponding left hand window;

3. (Optional) select the annotation file you would like to display or simply drag and drop it into the corresponding right hand window;

4. Click on **View Data;**

5. Use the **Manage Files** button (top right hand corner) and **Replace** buttons (in the dialog menu) to swap out new files as needed;

<Info>
  If you are uploading a segmentation file, Preview Mode will automatically map the annotations and display them as unique Instances in the left hand toolbar.
</Info>

Please note that images and volumes can be manipulated in Preview Mode just as they would be in the standard Annotation Tool. The following functions represent a non-exhaustive list of features available in Preview Mode:

* Windowing Settings

* Thresholding Settings

* MPR Layout

* Command Bar (and commands such as "toggle Linear Pixel Interpolation", "toggle permanent crosshairs", etc.)

* Oblique Planes

* Horizontal and Vertical Flipping

* Viewport Maximization and Minimization;

* ...and more!

<Warning>
  If you are uploading a segmentation file that contains **non-segmentation annotations** (e.g. length measurements, bounding boxes, etc.), the non-segmentation annotations will **not** display in Preview Mode.
</Warning>
