## Project Analytics

On your Project's Data Page, admins can easily access a variety of productivity-related information about the Project Workforce by using the lefthand toolbar and applying the desired filters.

To generate Task-based metrics for a specific user, first select the user in the top-left dropdown field and apply a date range.

## Task Analytics

RedBrick also allows users to see information related to the contents of Tasks that they have access to.

On the Data Page, a user can click on the Task Analytics button for a given Task to see information about:

* the Object Labels (i.e. annotations) present in the Task

* Task History

* Labeling History

* Reviewing History
